# Intinite cinema
Press a button and make a movie! Doesn't use any AI and it is highly configurable :P

## How it works
It is made from 2 parts - the writer which writes a script for a movie. It is highly configurable and has all the data for a movie to be made
The second part is the director, which turns this script into a watchable movie in 3D that follows the script 1 to 1. It provides the movie with choreography, lighting, music, dialogue

## I am bored and made this for fun and for experience
